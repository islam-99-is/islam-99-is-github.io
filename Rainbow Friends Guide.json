            "part2" : "Rainbow Friends is a Roblox horror experience that joins games like Piggy, Five Nights at Freddy’s, Poppy Playtime, and others, in taking something seemingly nice and friendly and turning it into a terrifying nightmare. It’s a popular formula too, with nearly 100 million visits accounted for by the frightening friends, proving to be one of the more unique titles Roblox has on offer.Just like the games from the FNAF series, Roblox’s Rainbow Friends takes place over the course of five nights, with each evening consisting of a special task or challenge you must complete while avoiding the multicoloured monstrosities. Of course, the price you pay for failing any of these tasks is high, especially considering you play as just a kid on a field trip, but there is a way to make it through the week. For more hair-raising scares and frightening times, be sure to check out our picks for the best Roblox horror games, as well as the best Switch horror games. Or, if all this talk of Freddy and the gang has you hankering to head back to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, check out our FNAF characters list and FNAF download guide.
