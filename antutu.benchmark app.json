It tests many parts of your device and assigns an overall score, and the results feature regularly in online reviews. But what is the AnTuTu score? Well, you can use AnTuTu Benchmark to analyze the performance of your device. Each test gets a score that gives you an idea of the capability of your device. You can then compare your scores with those of other phones on the market to see how it ranks among them."

The overall score is created by adding the results of those individual scores.These score numbers don't mean much on their own, they're just helpful for comparing different devices. For example, if your device's score is 300000, a device with a score of 600000 is about twice as fast. You can use individual test scores to compare the relative performance of specific parts of different devices. For example, you could compare how fast your phone's storage performs compared to another phone's storage."

A faster CPU can run apps faster, so everything on your device will seem faster. Of course, once you get to a certain point, CPU speed won't affect performance much. However, a faster CPU may still help when running more demanding applications, such as high-end games."

When you play a game, your GPU kicks into gear and renders the 3D graphics or accelerates the shiny 2D graphics. Many interface animations and other transitions also use the GPU.The GPU is optimized for these sorts of graphics operations.

RAM stands for random-access memory; while ROM stands for read-only memory.",
