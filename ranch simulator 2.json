The electric ones make the task easier. (the manual ones you need to spin the crank, kind of like the well for water but not as hard as the well is to spin. NOTE: you use a bucket to milk the cows, (get the bigger metal one and it will hold 7 units of milk from each cow. The milk jug will hold 42 units total). Once you milk a cow pour the bucket into the milk jug (tall milk container in store). You can pickup milk jug and point to either the pan with ground meat or an empty pan to get the option to add milk. Sausage uses 2 milk units and cheese uses 7 units."
