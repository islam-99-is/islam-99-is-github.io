This is the foundation of the profit from the sale of the apartment. 4- You don't have to complete every story mission up to 100%. This will, however, yield some additional funds. If the job's very difficult because you don't have the needed perks, you should pass up. 5-The game features a day-night cycle - if you find it annoying, you can turn it off in the menu. 6-The game is only saved upon quitting or going to the office. It cannot be saved otherwise. 7- The game lets you create only one profile - after finishing the story and repairing all buildings, the game technically ends."
