Traditional couscous is steamed in a special double-chambered cooking vessel called a couscousière. It is a multi-step, time-consuming process",
            "part2" : "However, in the States, the instant variety of couscous is much more prevalent. Because it is partially pre-cooked, it cooks in just 5 minutes, making it one of the easiest, fastest, most versatile side dishes you can have make — much quicker than rice or mashed potatoes. The cooking instructions on the back of the box make fine couscous, but this recipe shows how to take it up a notch."

Then, sauté shallot and garlic until fragrant, add tomato paste and spices, then toss in the eggplant, crushed tomatoes, and chicken broth. Lastly, add the couscous to the pan, layer the chicken thighs on top, and cover and cook until the couscous is al dente and the chicken is cooked through. Now that’s a dinner win."
